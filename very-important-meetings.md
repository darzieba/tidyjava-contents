Some time ago I stopped using Facebook or actually limited the usage to chatting with people. I rarely scroll down the wall and read posts. That decision didn't come easy for me. I had a feeling that I might not see something cool or important, that I really should see. All this despite the fact that every day I was seeing mostly ads, events I wouldn't go to, photos of people I don't care about, political stuff I don't care about either etc. Nothing interesting! And yet, I was really reluctant to stop. *That strange force inside me, telling me that I might be loosing something.*

Recently, I came to work, took a task from the agile board and started working. Some semi-interesting monitoring stuff. As it turned out, summing a few numbers in Grafana is not as easy as I expected. Then it began.

10:45 - standup time. Calling in, everybody discussing their stuff, bla, bla, as always.

11:00 - meeting with the manager. He wanted a recap of the last months with us, what we did good, what we could do better, something like a retrospective. A hot topic pops up - recruitment. Another hour lost on the same discussions, using the same arguments as on previous recruitment related meetings. I didn't even want to say anything, I didn't want to be bothered with it any more. Okay, recruitments talk is done. Some other topics to discuss and after 2 hours, we're finally done!

13:00 - lunch time. Eating is important, right?

14:00 - another meeting. Basically, some management guy telling us that they meet, they discuss what to do next and then they distribute it among the teams. Oh, and they draw nice diagrams. Thanks, I really couldn't live without that knowledge.

15:00 - anooother meeting. Our database master showing us some architectural diagrams and explaining why he's so busy, why our requests are taking so long, why the database is so fragile and important, that we can't do anything about it. To be honest, he was quite convincing, I started to pity him in the end.

17:00 - !@#$ it, time to go home.

That day, I came out of work and was like: WHAT THE !@#$ MAN!? Why am I doing this? This is the exact opposite of productive! I lost over 6 hours, sitting and talking, instead of doing my actual job - writing code! Whyyy?

Okay, standups are important, we need to be on the same page. (Although I sometimes wonder if it's necessary when we're sitting next to each other.) The manager wants to create a good working environment for us, I think I can't blame him for that. Meals are super-important, nobody doubts that. Those other guys probably thought that it's nice for us to know something about other teams in the company. But all of these on the same day?! `MeetingStackOverflowException`.

Then I started wondering, why exactly am I doing this. Why am I going to all these meetings? Is it really necessary? If not, why I decline meetings so rarely? It's not a new problem, some time ago we had similar issues with meetings, mostly due to interviews and a lot of product alignments. And yet I'm still doing this. Why?

Because I think there might be something important there. That knowing these things, listening to these discussions, taking part in them will let me better understand my job, company's needs, maybe even push things in a better direction. It's hard to resist, there's *that strange force inside me, telling me that I might be loosing something.*

It's time to face the truth. Same as I won't miss anything important by not following Facebook, I probably won't miss anything by not going to *most* of these meetings. It's even less probable that I'd loose something if one person from the team goes to the meeting and tells the others what was it about.

One should go only to those meetings, that he knows he has to attend - the **VIM**s. For others, one should follow the message I got in a captcha some time ago:

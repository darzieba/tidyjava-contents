title: I miss frustration!

Recently, I noticed lack of inspiration for writing. None of the topics I've listed down on my to-write list seems worthwhile. All of these things are already written down somewhere by someone and I just don't feel like repeating them. One more article about SOLID, Design Patterns or Clean Code? Not today.

After giving it some thought, I came to conclusion that my lack of inspiration is caused by lack of frustration. I don't see any big problems with projects I'm working on, so I don't feel like the world needs more explanation. Of course, this isn't true, but it really feels that way. Therefore, I decided to list things about my current job that prevent my frustration and somehow limit valuable content here.

### Clean Code
Good code quality is rare, at least in most companies, but not here, not in our projects. Even though we often have different understandings of some terms or simplicity in general, the code in our projects *is* clean. It's easy to read, understand and work with, and that's a great value. Even the old monolith, that we have to deal with is not *that* bad, comparing to what I've seen in other companies.

### Code Reviews
This one's extremely important. Collective ownership means that the code I write is not mine, it's ours. All members of the team are responsible for it and therefore should know what's inside and how to work with it. Also, code reviews help us keep the code clean. Nobody is perfect and we often overlook things. Something that looks simple to me, might not be simple to my colleagues. Having this information, we can work towards something that all of us like.

### Pair Programming
Something I used to be skeptical about. Why would we cut our velocity in half? Why would I have to explain everything I do to the person next to me? Isn't that boring for the person currently *not* writing code? Well, none of these is true. Programming together helps us keep focused for longer periods of time and solve problems faster. We're throwing thoughts at each other and things magically get easier. It takes collective ownership even further - not only we know the code, we wrote it together. Also, code reviews after pair programming tend to go smoother, as the code is simple and clean already. And it's a lot of fun!

### Good Tests
A good test suite is probably the most important thing in a software project. It gives us confidence that we do the thing right. It helps us keep code quality high, because we're not afraid of refactoring. It practically eliminates debugging. And, again, it's a rare thing in software projects. All projects I worked on before were either under-tested or had other problems with tests e.g. lots of false-negatives, long execution time etc. Luckily, that's no longer a problem for me. We have a suite of clean, fast tests of different kinds - from unit level to whole system level.

### Quick Builds
If I were given back all the time I wasted on builds, I would read an extra book or two. Projects grow and so do build times. Waiting a few minutes for the build every small change to the project is unacceptable. Now, I'm working on small, new projects and things don't get out of hand.

### Continuous Delivery
At the moment on the level of continuous tickets to the ops guy, but that's still a great thing. Every change I make, I can put into production within days/hours instead of months/weeks. My past experiences suggest that it's not that hard to release often - automated tests, continuous interation tool, one fast way to deploy and you're ready to go. To me, continuous delivery is one of the most important things about agile.

### Small Teams
A two-pizza team, especially when we consider XXL pizzas, can be too big. 3-5 people working closely on a small project lets you go really fast, stay on the same page and emphasizes collective ownership. Even though, I would likely reunite all the dragons together in a team, I'm fine with working with just 2 of them. Small is beautiful :)

### Self-improvement
I really like the fact that people around me are continously improving. This reassures me that I'm working with the right people and motivates me to do the same. The worst thing that can happen to you is people staying in place and even discouraging you, just to feel better. I'm glad it's not the case for me.

### Good Equipment
Last point, maybe not that important, but I've had issues with that in the past. In one company, I even had to use my own computer, despite working in the office. Here, we've got really decent computers and all other equipment that we need.

### Final Thoughts
It's not just bragging about how great my current company is. Actually, I hope that putting more focus on things mentioned here can help you make your projects better and work more pleasant. As for me, I think I'll have to find some mini-frustrations or something :)
